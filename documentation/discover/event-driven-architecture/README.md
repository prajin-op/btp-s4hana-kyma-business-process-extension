# Learn the concepts behind business events and event-driven architectures

Business Event capabilities allow you to publish events from SAP sources such as SAP S/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP ERP Central Component (SAP ECC), SAP SuccessFactors, and SAP Customer Experience, and also from external sources. SAP Enterprise Messaging can transport enabled events to consumers, for example, extension apps built on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). Event-driven architectures of this kind enable seamless communication and integration across different platforms.

Access the following documents to make yourself familiar with business events and event-driven architectures:
* Event-driven extensions on SAP BTP provide an overview of the basic concepts (attached)
* Browse the [SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/) for available events

These documents and materials provide the big picture of why you would want to use event-driven architectures and how all of this works in an SAP context.
